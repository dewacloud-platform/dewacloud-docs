# Quotas System

While working with the platform, you can notice some features being completely or partially restricted (e.g. [public IP](https://docs.dewacloud.com/docs/public-ip/) option or number of [cloudlets](https://docs.dewacloud.com/docs/cloudlet/) per container) by your particular service hosting provider. In most cases, such limitations are provided for trial accounts only, so [upgrading](https://docs.dewacloud.com/docs/upgrade-refill-account/) will automatically unlock access to all of the platform functionality.

If you still require some quotas enlargement after account conversion, please, contact your hosting service provider to get an assistance.

The actual account permissions can be viewed via the **Quotas & Pricing > Account Limits** window at the platform dashboard.
