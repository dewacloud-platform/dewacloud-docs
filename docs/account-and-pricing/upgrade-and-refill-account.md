# Upgrade & Refill Account

After the initial trial period, if you are satisfied with our product and wish to continue to use the platform, your account should be upgraded to the [billing](https://docs.dewacloud.com/docs/types-of-accounts/) one. The conversion will additionally remove any limitations and provide access to all of the available functionality.

:::tip
If you don’t have an account yet, choose the most suitable service provider for you (based on the geolocation, performance, support quality, etc.) and sign up for a free trial. The platform will automatically send the confirmation email, so just follow the provided instructions (an additional captcha or SMS verification may be required).
:::

1\. Log into the platform dashboard and click the **Upgrade Account** button at the top.

  * _Weekly (every Monday)_
  * _Monthly (1st of each month)_
