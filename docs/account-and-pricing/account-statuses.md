# Account Statuses

Platform accounts can have different statuses:

  * **Active**

If your account is active, all your _environments are running_.

  * **Deactivated**

In this case, you still have access to the platform dashboard, but you cannot create new environments, and all existing ones are _stopped_ and cannot be edited (only removed).

If you have a _trial_ account, it can be deactivated due to the trial period/credits expiration. _Convert your account_ to the billing one and it will be activated automatically.

If you have a _billing_ account, it can be deactivated due to lack of money. _Replenish the account_ and it will be reactivated automatically.

All your environments will be _automatically started_ upon account reactivation, so no additional actions are required.

  * **Suspended**

The account can be suspended if you broke any part of the agreement with the Service Provider. After that, all the environments will be stopped and you _won’t be able to sign in_. To reactivate your account, you need to _contact hoster’s support_.

  * **Destroyed**

In this case, you still have access to the platform dashboard, but all of your _environments are deleted_ and you can’t recover them.

It happens in two cases. First, if you personally ask to delete it. Secondly, if your account is deactivated and you don’t do anything to activate it during some period of time stated by hoster.

If you wish to recover your account, log in to the dashboard and refill your balance to make it positive.
