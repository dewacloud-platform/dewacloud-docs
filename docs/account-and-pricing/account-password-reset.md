# Account Password Reset

The platform makes sure that account passwords are regularly updated through the automatic deprecation mechanism. By default, passwords expire after 180 days (with several heads-up notifications) and need to be renewed to restore access to the account.

If you still retain access to your account, follow the [change password](https://docs.dewacloud.com/docs/#change-password) flow. If you’ve forgotten your current password or it has already expired, the platform provides a reliable and secure flow to [reset your password](https://docs.dewacloud.com/docs/#reset-password).

## Password Requirements{#password-requirements}

User accounts security is the top priority for the platform, so the following password requirements are enforced by default:

  * the minimum length of 10 characters
  * at least one symbol for each of the following categories: numbers, lowercase and uppercase letters, special characters
  * must not repeat any of the previous passwords

:::warning
The exact requirements for each platform are defined by the appropriate service hosting providers and can vary from the default ones.

Also, we recommend configuring **[Two-Factor Authentication](https://docs.dewacloud.com/docs/two-factor-authentication/)** for an additional layer of protection to drastically increase the account’s security.
